When measuring the best fit for a regression, using the Sum of errors and sum of errors square are good.
An issue is that if we are comparing two regressions with the same slope, it can have different errors based on the amount of data points available.
To counteract this issue, we can use R-squared value to determine the correlation.
R-squared is a range from 0 to 1 with 0 meaning no correlation.
